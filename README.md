# MS-Thesis-Template

> This template was inspired by Pranav Minasandra's (@pminasandra) [template](https://github.com/pminasandra/iisc-bio-thesis/blob/master/template.pdf). I have added the option of including appendices and some comments that allow for easier comprehension, navigation and editing especially for novices like me.


I have included dummy figures, text and citations everywhere. Be sure to get rid of them. Below is a list of some obvious thingd to replace before you use.

- Path to references.bib (in line 40)
- The title (in line 97)
- Name of degree (in line 101)
- Name, Department, Institute (in line 104)
- path to logo image (in line 105)
- Prof etc. (in lines 106-108)
- Labels defined as \\label{} eg. \\label{sec:firstone}
